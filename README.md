OMHClient
======

This is the repository for the Open mHealth DSU iOS client library.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

The Open mHealth DSU uses the Google+ platform for user authentication, so this library has a dependency on the Google+ iOS SDK. In addition to including all the files in this repository in your project, your project must include all the frameworks required by the Google+ iOS SDK:

* AddressBook.framework
* AssetsLibrary.framework
* Foundation.framework
* CoreLocation.framework
* CoreMotion.framework
* CoreGraphics.framework
* CoreText.framework
* MediaPlayer.framework
* Security.framework
* SystemConfiguration.framework
* UIKit.framework

CLIENT SETUP
------------------------

In order to sign in to the DSU, your app will need four keys:

1. A Google+ client ID for your app (associated with your app's bundle ID)
2. A Google+ client ID for the DSU server you're using
3. A DSU client ID for your app
4. The DSU client secret for your DSU client ID

Your app should use these keys to setup the client in your app delegate's `applicationDidFinishLaunching` by calling 
```
[OMHClient setupClientWithAppGoogleClientID:(1)
                       serverGoogleClientID:(2)
                             appDSUClientID:(3)
                         appDSUClientSecret:(4)];
```
